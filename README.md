# Stanford-CS236-Deep-Generative-Models-
This repository contains homeworks and projects completed as part of CS236: Deep Generative Models at Stanford University. The course focuses on the theoretical foundations and practical implementations of modern generative modeling techniques.

Topics covered include probabilistic modeling, variational inference, autoregressive models, normalizing flows, energy-based models, and diffusion-based generative models. The assignments emphasize both mathematical understanding and hands-on implementation of generative algorithms.

All work in this repository was developed as part of formal coursework and reflects systematic exploration of state-of-the-art generative modeling methods.
